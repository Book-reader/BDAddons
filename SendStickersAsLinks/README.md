# SendStickersAsLinks

Allows you to send custom Stickers as links (basically an image). 

***Custom Stickers:** Stickers that are added by servers and not discord's own Stickers.* 

## Features

- If sticker can be sent as normal sticker, it will be.
- Setting to highlight animated Stickers.
- Setting to ignore Embed permissions.
- Setting to not send animated Stickers.

#### Notes:

- Animated Stickers cannot be used as they are, because of the limitations discord has put in place, which means if you send an animated sticker it will only show the first frame.
- Preview below may not be as accurate, some features have been removed because they are impossible to reimplement.
