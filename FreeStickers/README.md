# FreeStickers

With this plugin you can send custom stickers as their link counterpart , custom stickers means those that are added by guild owners and not discord's own stock sticker. 

#### Notes:
- If sticker can be sent as normal sticker, it will be.
- Animated stickers cannot be used as they are, because of the limitations discord has put into place, which means if you send an animated sticker it will only show the first frame.
- Side features includes preview popout for Stickers and emojis.
