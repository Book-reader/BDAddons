# LazyLoadChannels

Do you get annoyed when you accidently click a channel and now discord hangs for a bit so you have to wait for it to load just so that you can click away ?

Do you get annoyed when you click on a server and it takes you to their top channel which you also have to wait for to load just so that you can finally go where you want ?

Do you get annoyed when navigating servers and you run into channels full of Embeds/reactions that take ages to load ?

Well Not anymore.

The main goal of **LazyLoadChannels** is to prevent channels from loading untill you choose to do so, solving all the issues mentioned above.

You can chose to auto load a specefic channel, or a whole server. *DMs can be included in settings*
